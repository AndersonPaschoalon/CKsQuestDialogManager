<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): But, before we proceed, I have a question. Why do you want to join the Silver Hands?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic02</p>
<p>Player: I want to hunt Werewolves.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): An adventure seeker eh? We need more people like you here.</p>

<li>
<p>DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic04</p>
<p>Player: What things?</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Disgust 50): We fight against these beasts to cleanse this foul daedric disease that has taken the sanity of many of our brothers and sisters here on Skyrim.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Anger 50): But worst than that, have corrupted the souls of many sons of Skyrim, and take them away from Sovngarde in exchange of an ephemeral power in life.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Disgust 50): But, you must be aware. No only beggars and forgotten people have lycanthropy here on Skyrim.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Anger 50): Many influential and powerful  people have this curse... or "gift" as many of them say. </p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): If you become a Silver Hand, you will have to fight not only physically, but also politically and economically powerful people.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic05</p>
<p>Player: Yes, I do!</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Now, you are officially a silver hand initiate. Take this armor and shield.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): They are not expensive ones, but are especially good to protect against the cold weather of the ice fields.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Take this weapon, it is a Silver sword. It will protect you against foul creatures we fight against.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): I will give you one book too, it is called Songs of Return, volume seven.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Read it, you will learn more about the Ysgramor and its legacy.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Each Silver Hand must read one of this.</p>
<p>DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Downstairs, there is a library, where you will find other useful book, if you are interested to learn more.</p>
