# CK's Quest Dialog Manager


The Quest Dialog Manager, a feature of the Creation Kit, offers mod creators a simple solution for managing quest dialogs.

The tool allows for the export of dialog information from the Creation Kit to be imported and utilized in a streamlined content management system.

> *Dialog View window in the creation kit.*

As a mod developer, creating new quests for the game of Skyrim often involves creating dialogs and scenes for the Dragonborn to interact with NPCs in the world. However, I found the process of reviewing and editing these dialogs to be tedious and time-consuming. I had to navigate through dozens of boxes in the Creation Kit to find the text I needed to review, and keeping track of changes was difficult as the drafts quickly became outdated.

When other people began to offer to help with the quest, I struggled to provide them with the most current version of the story script in a readable format. I realized that I needed a way to automatically generate documentation for the dialogs to make the review process easier and more efficient.

The Creation Kit allows for exporting dialogs in a CSV format, but it is difficult to read and understand without context. I decided to create a tool that could help me generate readable documentation automatically. Starting as a simple script, the tool eventually evolved into a content manager with multiple features that use the information imported from the Creation Kit.

With this tool, I can now easily:

* Create beautiful documentation for my quests in a variety of formats, including HTML, Markdown, DOCX, and JSON.

* Manage audio files from quests in an organized way. I can easily find, open, and play audio files according to their subtitle, extract information, and convert them to different formats.

* Generate mute audio files with approximate speaking times for the text in the audio.

After reaching a stable version, I decided to share it with the community on Nexus. I hope it will be useful for other mod developers as well.
