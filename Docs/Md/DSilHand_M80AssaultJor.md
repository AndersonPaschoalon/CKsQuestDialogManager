#### Phase 0: Fjol

(Happy 70): Brothers, put down your weapons!! The Companions are not our enemies!    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047975_1``    


#### Phase 1: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Happy 50): Brothers, put down your weapons!!    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047411_1``    

(Happy 50): The Companions are not our enemies. They are our Brothers in blood. A long time ago we all were the same group!    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047411_2``    

(Happy 50): But we, the Silver Hand did not accepted this Werewolf abomination you all are seeing now!    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047411_3``    

(Happy 50): This is a curse  brought by the Witches Glenmoril into the heart of the Companions.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047411_4``    

(Happy 50): Since then, it was perpetuated be daedric rituals of blood devoted to Hircine.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047411_5``    

(Happy 50): We split into two separated groups, and we have been fighting for centuries.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047411_6``    

(Happy 50): But now, the Circle was defeated and Companions are free from the Daedric curse! It's time to rejoy again!    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047411_7``    


#### Phase 4: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Neutral 50): Fjol.. as I see, I was not quick enough... I knew it was coming to this one day.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004797A_1``    


#### Phase 5: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Neutral 50): Yes, we did it Vignar. We cleaned the Circle from the Hircine Curse. Now the Companion are free from Lycantropy, and we vanged Krev death.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00047EDF_1``    


#### Phase 6: Vignar Gray Mane

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``ElderRace``, Voice Type:``MaleOldGrumpy``.

(Sad 70): So it happened... Krev is dead too...    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_1``    

(Sad 70): No more cursed blood among the Companion, no more fight among us and the dissidents. But I have two conditions.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_10``    

(Sad 70): It has passed a long time since we were young.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_2``    

(Sad 70): We all: I, Kodlack, Krev and you were great friends...    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_3``    

(Sad 70): We fought together many times... But Krev and you decided to follow the dissidents' path.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_4``    

(Sad 70): Kodlack and I decide to stay.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_5``    

(Sad 70): He decided join the Circle. He thought it was the right thing to do.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_6``    

(Sad 70): You know... Kodlack was searching for a cure. I think he was feeling this vary day was coming...    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_7``    

(Sad 70): It was only a matter of time.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_8``    

(Sad 70): I will not perpetuate this bloodshed. As the elder Companion member I offer you a peace agreement.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048444_9``    


#### Phase 7: Vignar Gray Mane

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``--``, Voice Type:``MaleOldGrumpy``.

(Sad 70): First, the cursed blood has gone, but we must keep it as a secret. The people here in Whiterun don't need to know the rumors are indeed true.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048F20_1``    

(Sad 70): Second: I cannot let you and your group rejoin the Companions.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048F20_2``    

(Sad 70): After all of this bloodshed, your presence would not be tolerated by any of Whiterun's clans.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048F20_3``    

(Sad 70): This would escalate to another endless war among our factions once again.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048F20_4``    

(Sad 70): You and our group should not come to Whiterun. At least not for a long time, until the wounds are healed...    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048F20_5``    


#### Phase 8: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Neutral 50): Actually, I did not want to come back either. After so many years in the wilds, I get used to it.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048446_1``    

(Neutral 50): The silence and the solitude of the northern wilds and winds are part of me now.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048446_2``    

(Neutral 50): The vengeance has been made, the cursed blood is no more, and the pride of Ysgramor is restored.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048446_3``    

(Neutral 50): It costed the blood of many generations, and the wounds are deep.  I hope some day they will be closed.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048446_4``    


#### Phase 9: Vignar Gray Mane

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``ElderRace``, Voice Type:``MaleOldGrumpy``.

(Sad 70): I hope that too Fjol.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048448_1``    

(Sad 70): So that's it. You need to leave as soon as possible...    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048448_2``    


#### Phase 10: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Neutral 50): We will Vignar. But first wee need to use the Skyforge.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004844A_1``    


#### Phase 11: Vignar Gray Mane

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``ElderRace``, Voice Type:``MaleOldGrumpy``.

(Sad 70): Do whatenever you want, but do not get attention, and be quick as possible. And do not spill any more blood.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004844C_1``    


#### Phase 12: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Neutral 50): I promisse I will.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004844E_1``    


#### Phase 13: Vignar Gray Mane

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``ElderRace``, Voice Type:``MaleOldGrumpy``.

(Neutral 50): Good. Athis, come here.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048450_1``    


#### Phase 15: Athis

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``DarkElfRace``, Voice Type:``MaleDarkElf``.

(Neutral 50): Yes sir...    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048452_1``    


#### Phase 16: Vignar Gray Mane

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``--``, Voice Type:``MaleOldGrumpy``.

(Neutral 50): Since Kodlak died, We need a new harbinger. I think it should be you.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048454_1``    


#### Phase 17: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Neutral 50): Vignar, the Companions were meant to be brothers sworn by blood, not by leadership. There should be no harbinger. Not for a long time, at least.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048456_1``    


#### Phase 18: Vignar Gray Mane

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``ElderRace``, Voice Type:``MaleOldGrumpy``.

(Neutral 50): Hmm, I think you're right. We've seen the secrets that can harm our faction.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__00048458_1``    


#### Phase 19: Athis

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``DarkElfRace``, Voice Type:``MaleDarkElf``.

(Anger 50): Damn it... I was THIS close.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004845A_1``

#### Phase 4: Fjol

> Dialog Type:``Scene``, Actor Race:``NordRace``, Voice Type:``MaleEvenTonedAccented``.

(Happy 70): Brothers and sisters. Today is a great day that will be remembered through the ages.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004591E_1``    

(Happy 50): Bards will sing songs calling our names, in memory  of what we did today.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004591E_2``    

(Neutral 50): In the very same day, we freed Skyrim's heart from the foul Hircine influence, and reassembled the ancient axe: Wuuthrad.    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004591E_3``    

(Neutral 50): Today Ysgramor's honor over this land is finally restored!    

``DSilHand_M80AssaultJor__0004591E_4``
