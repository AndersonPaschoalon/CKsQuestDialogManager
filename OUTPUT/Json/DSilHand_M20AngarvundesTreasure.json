He will talk about Ysgramor and the pieces of Wuuthrad and send you on an adventure together with Hillara. You can talk to her downstairs. She will accompany you in the exploration of Angarvunde, an ancient Nord Tomb on The Rift. The fragment will be located in its main chamber, closer to a Word Wall, inside a boss chest. Once you find the fragment, you will have to bring it back to Krev.",
