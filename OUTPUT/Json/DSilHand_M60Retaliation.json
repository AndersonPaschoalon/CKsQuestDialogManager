Arriving in the main chamber, you will discover that Krev was killed by the Companions. Senaar will talk to you and ask you o go to Driftshade and tell to Fjol what happened. At this point, you may call him to be your follower.  In Diftshade you will be able to tell Fjol what happened. He will tell you things about Krev's past, and make a discourse for all the Silver Hands telling that Krev has perished bravely. After the discourse, he will talk to you in particular and offer the leadership of Gallows Rock fort.",
