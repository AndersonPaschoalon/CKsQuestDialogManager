He will tell a location where some Companions may be executing a job contract: Bonechill Passage. Arriving there, you will find two companions, Njada and her Shield Brother. They will attack you. After defeating them, you might go back to Gallows Rock. Once you arrive, you will find two Companions fighting the guards outside. The quest will be automatically completed, and the next will start.",
