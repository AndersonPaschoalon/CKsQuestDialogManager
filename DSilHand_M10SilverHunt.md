* DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic01

	Player: Are you Krev the Skinner? I'm here because I want to join the Silver Hand.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Happy 50): Yes I'm! Welcome! You did well against the frost troll on the Cold Rock Pass. Congratulations! You proceed well on our initiation.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): But, before we proceed, I have a question. Why do you want to join the Silver Hands?

* DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic02

	Player: I want to hunt Werewolves.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): An adventure seeker eh? We need more people like you here.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): But I have more things to say before you can join us. 

* DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic03

	Player: I want to fight against the influence of Daedra in Skyrim.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): This is an honor cause that every sons and daughters of Skyrim who wish to go Sovngarde one day, must fight for.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): But I have more things to say before you can join us. 

* DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic04

	Player: What things?

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Disgust 50): We fight against these beasts to cleanse this foul daedric disease that has taken the sanity of many of our brothers and sisters here on Skyrim.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Anger 50): But worst than that, have corrupted the souls of many sons of Skyrim, and take them away from Sovngarde in exchange of an ephemeral power in life.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Disgust 50): But, you must be aware. No only beggars and forgotten people have lycanthropy here on Skyrim.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Anger 50): Many influential and powerful  people have this curse... or "gift" as many of them say. 

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): If you become a Silver Hand, you will have to fight not only physically, but also politically and economically powerful people.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Puzzled 50): After all I said, do you still want to become a Silver Hand?

* DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic05

	Player: Yes, I do!

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Now, you are officially a silver hand initiate. Take this armor and shield.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): They are not expensive ones, but are especially good to protect against the cold weather of the ice fields.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Take this weapon, it is a Silver sword. It will protect you against foul creatures we fight against.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): I will give you one book too, it is called Songs of Return, volume seven.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Read it, you will learn more about the Ysgramor and its legacy.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Each Silver Hand must read one of this.

	DSilHand_KrevTheSkinner (Neutral 50): Downstairs, there is a library, where you will find other useful book, if you are interested to learn more.
